# Hybrid-AI-Chiller-Controller
This project uses Artificial Intelligence to automatically determine the optimal chilled water supply temperature (CHWS) for large buildings, based on real-time conditions like TR Load, ambient temperature, and electricity consumption.
It combines:

Machine Learning (Reinforcement Learning) for data-driven control

Physics-based rules to ensure realistic temperature ranges

This hybrid approach makes the chiller system both intelligent and energy-efficient.

ðŸ§© Key Features

âœ… Predicts chilled water temperature dynamically
âœ… Adapts to load and ambient temperature changes
âœ… Combines AI learning with physical HVAC principles
âœ… Interactive Gradio Web Interface
âœ… Realistic trend â€” colder water for higher load

ðŸ§  How It Works

The model takes three inputs:

TR Load (Tons of Refrigeration)

Ambient Temperature (Â°C)

Electricity Consumed (kW)

and outputs:

Recommended Chilled Water Supply Temperature (Â°C)

Working Flow:

Generate or collect chiller operation data

Train a Reinforcement Learning model using PyTorch

Apply hybrid logic (AI + HVAC physics)

Deploy as a Gradio interface for real-time prediction
